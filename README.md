# Work-Day-Scheduler

## A simple calendar application to keep your busy days in order!

I have created a calendar app where users can save their events and view their daily work schedule.  User data is saved for whenever they would like to reference their schedule.  

## App Description:

The work-day-scheduler was created with dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery, Moment.js, fontawesome.com, Bootstrap, and googleAPIs.com were also added for additional functionality
